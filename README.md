# Discordbots
My repo for some of my discord bots.

For every bot I have I will leave a link to the tutorial I used if I used any.

When using one of these bots, you have to make a ``.env ``file with in it ``TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN HERE>``, your bot token you can get at the [Discord developer console]. Then clicking the button that says `New aplication` and giving it a name.
Go to the bots section, create a bot and there you click on the copy token button.
